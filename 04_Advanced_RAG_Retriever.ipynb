Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the amounts reported. Actual results could diﬀer\nmaterially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassiﬁed to conform to\nthe current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s ﬁscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter every\nﬁve or six years to realign the Company’s ﬁscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the ﬁrst quarter of the Company’s ﬁscal year ending September\n30, 2023. The Company’s ﬁscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to\nbe entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment\nand title and the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales,\ncontrol transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs.\nWhen observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reﬂect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations\nwould be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may\nvary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for\nsimilar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identiﬁed up to \nthree\n performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The ﬁrst performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the\ntime of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\n, Siri\n and Maps. The third\nperformance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspeciﬁed software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each\ndevice. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks\nobservable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.

Interest expense \ndecreased due to a decrease in  outstanding long -term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on \ninvestments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. Net losses \non derivatives increased due to losses related to managing st rategic investments.  \nINCOME TAXES  \nEffective Tax Rate  \nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023  and 2022  was 19% and 1 3%, respectively . The increase in our effective tax \nrate was primarily due to a `$`3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the trans fer \nof intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock -based compensation.  \nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to \nthe U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a `$`3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fisc al \nyear 2 022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible \nlow-taxed income tax.  \nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in \nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional \noperations center in Ireland.  \nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a \nresult of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023 , our \nU.S. income before income taxes was `$` 52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was `$` 36.4 billion. In \nfiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was `$`47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes \nwas `$`35.9 billion.  \nUncertain Tax Positions  \nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In \nFebruary 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to \n2006 and reopened the audit  phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 \nto 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second \nquarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an  additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a \npayment of `$`1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  \nAs of  June 30, 2023 , the primary unresolved issues for the  IRS audits relate  to transfer pricing, which could have a \nmaterial impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for \nincome tax contingencies are adequate . We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer \npricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.  Based on the information \ncurrently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues \nwithin the next 12 months.  \nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain\n\n{'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Microsoft_2023.pdf', 'page': 44}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 5:\n\nPART II  \nItem 8  \n91 No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue \nfor fiscal years 2023 , 2022 , or 2021 .

Additions to property and equipment will \ncontinue, including new f acilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and \nmarketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support \ngrowth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for \ndatacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain \nequipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with u nconsolidated entities or \nother persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  \nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing \nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, re venue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a \nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of \noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in  the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment \nsecurities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  \nRevenue Recognition  \nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. \nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted \nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud -based service includes both on -\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is \nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct  and accounted for together with the cloud service and \nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, \ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services,  and are accounted for \ntogether as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the \ncloud services are provided.  \nJudgment is required to determine the stand -alone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We  \nuse a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on -premises licenses sold with \nSA or  software updates provided at no additional charge.  We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell \neach of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based \non the relative SSP of the various products and s ervices.  \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.

Interest expense \ndecreased due to a decrease in  outstanding long -term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on \ninvestments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. Net losses \non derivatives increased due to losses related to managing st rategic investments.  \nINCOME TAXES  \nEffective Tax Rate  \nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023  and 2022  was 19% and 1 3%, respectively . The increase in our effective tax \nrate was primarily due to a `$`3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the trans fer \nof intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock -based compensation.  \nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to \nthe U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a `$`3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fisc al \nyear 2 022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible \nlow-taxed income tax.  \nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in \nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional \noperations center in Ireland.  \nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a \nresult of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023 , our \nU.S. income before income taxes was `$` 52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was `$` 36.4 billion. In \nfiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was `$`47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes \nwas `$`35.9 billion.  \nUncertain Tax Positions  \nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In \nFebruary 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to \n2006 and reopened the audit  phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 \nto 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second \nquarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an  additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a \npayment of `$`1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  \nAs of  June 30, 2023 , the primary unresolved issues for the  IRS audits relate  to transfer pricing, which could have a \nmaterial impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for \nincome tax contingencies are adequate . We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer \npricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.  Based on the information \ncurrently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues \nwithin the next 12 months.  \nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain\n\n{'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Microsoft_2023.pdf', 'page': 44}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 4:\n\nApple Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 – \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the amounts reported. Actual results could diﬀer\nmaterially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassiﬁed to conform to\nthe current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s ﬁscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter every\nﬁve or six years to realign the Company’s ﬁscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the ﬁrst quarter of the Company’s ﬁscal year ending September\n30, 2023. The Company’s ﬁscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to\nbe entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment\nand title and the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales,\ncontrol transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs.\nWhen observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reﬂect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations\nwould be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may\nvary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for\nsimilar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identiﬁed up to \nthree\n performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The ﬁrst performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the\ntime of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\n, Siri\n and Maps. The third\nperformance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspeciﬁed software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each\ndevice.

This segment primarily comprises:  \n• Windows, including Windows OEM  licensing  (“Windows OEM”)  and other non -volume licensing of the \nWindows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating \nsystem, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows  \nIoT. \n• Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.  \n• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first - and third -party content \n(including games and in -game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, \nadvertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services.  \n• Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and \nthird-party affiliates.  \nWindows  \nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling \nconsistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted \nsignificantly by the number of Win dows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre -install on the \ndevices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:  \n• The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.  \n• Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.  \n• Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.  \n• Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.  \n• Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.  \n• Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts \nfrom local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows \nversions licensed.  \n• Constraints in the supply chain of device components.  \n• Piracy.  \nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud \nservices such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for \nvolume licensing and Software Ass urance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial \nrevenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the \nnumber of PCs sold in a given year.  \nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, \nincluding mobile devices and cloud offerings.  \nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating \nsystems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.  \nDevices  \nWe design and sell devices, including Surface , HoloLens,  and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable \npeople and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated \nMicrosoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and co nsumers be more\n\n{'page': 13, 'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Microsoft_2023.pdf'}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 2:\n\nExhibit 32.2  \nCERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO  \nSECTION 906 OF THE SARBANES -OXLEY ACT OF 2002  \n(18 U.S.C.

The\nextent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and ﬁnancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors\noutside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability,\ndistribution and eﬀectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy\nand demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse eﬀects on demand for the Company’s\nproducts and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s\nprofitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely aﬀects the Company’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price, it may also have the eﬀect\nof heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can\nharm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse eﬀect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\ngenerally beneﬁts from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conﬂicts can result in\ntariﬀs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, particularly if these measures occur\nin regions where the Company derives a signiﬁcant portion of its revenues and/or has signiﬁcant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S.\nand China have led to a series of tariﬀs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariﬀs increase the cost of\nthe Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the\nCompany earns on its products. Tariﬀs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less\ncompetitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could\nadversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to oﬀer its products and services as designed. These measures can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to oﬀer third-party applications on its\nplatforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\nCompany’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to eﬀectively mitigate all adverse\nimpacts from such measures. If disputes and conﬂicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be signiﬁcantly more severe and\nrestrictive and could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a\nnegative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that\n\n{'page': 9, 'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Apple_2022.pdf'}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 4:\n\nbased on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product\nsales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market\nshare. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and\noperating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their\napplications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisﬁed customers\nand lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\n\n{'page': 12, 'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Apple_2023.pdf'}"

While we employ much of our internally -developed intellectual property in our products and services, we \nalso engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. \nFrom time to time, we ent er into broader cross -license agreements with other technology companies covering entire \ngroups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At \ntimes, we make select intellectual property broadl y available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as \npromoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting \nand enabling our external development community. Our increasin g engagement with open source software will also \ncause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.  \nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products  and \nservices, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on \ncommercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially \ndependent on any single license  or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.  \nInvesting in the Future  \nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, \nto initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad \nadoption of our produc ts and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we \nbelieve offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our \nassessment of key technology trends, we maintai n our long -term commitment to research and development across a \nwide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, \ndevices, and operating systems.   \nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate \nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us \nremain competitive in local ma rkets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.  \nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, \nand as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the \nresults across the company.   \nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research \nis one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations , often  work ing in close collaboration with top universities \naround the world , and is focused on advancing the state -of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other \ndisciplines . Our investment in fundamental research  provides  us a unique perspective on future trends and contributes  \nto our innovation.  \nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING  \nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and \nresellers. Our sales  organization  performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises \nand public -sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation \nrequirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting sys tem integrators, independent software vendors, and \nother partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our \nproducts and services.  \nOEMs\n\n{'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Microsoft_2023.pdf', 'page': 16}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 2:\n\nTotal    `$` 211,915     `$` 198,270      `$` 168,088    \n                       \nOur Microsoft Cloud  revenue, which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial \nportion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was `$` 111.6 billion, `$` 91.4 billion , and `$` 69.1 \nbillion in fiscal years 2023 , 2022 , and 2021 , respectively.

The Company sells its\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company\nalso employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.

As with all companies, these\nsecurity measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty\npassword management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into\ndisclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and\nservices. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services\nand systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer\norders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insuﬃcient to\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\n{'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Apple_2023.pdf', 'page': 14}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 7:\n\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM \n10-K\n(Mark One)\n☒\n \nANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended \nSeptember 30\n, 2023\nor\n☐\n \nTRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the transition period from \n            \n to \n            \n.\nCommission File Number: \n001-36743\nApple Inc.\n(Exact name of Registrant as specified in its charter)\nCalifornia\n94-2404110\n(State or other jurisdiction\nof incorporation or organization)\n(I.R.S.

We have approximately 16 million square feet of \nspace located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other \ngeneral and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately 11 million square feet of owned space \nsituated on approximately 5 30 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately 5 million square \nfeet of space we lease.  \nWe own and lease  other facilities domestically and internationally , primarily  for office s, datacenter s, and research and \ndevelopment . The largest owned international properties include space in the following locations: China, India, Ireland, \nand the Netherlands. The largest leased international properties include space in the following locations: Australia, \nCanada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan,  the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.  Refer to  \nResearch and Development (Part I, Item  1 of this Form 10 -K) for further discussion of our research and development \nfacilities . \nIn fiscal year 2023, we made  decisions to consolidate our office leases to create higher density across our workspaces , \nand we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.  \nThe table below shows a summary of the square footage of our properties  owned and leased domestically and \ninternationally as of June 30, 2023 : \n \n(Square feet in millions)    \n   \n     \nLocation    Owned      Leased      Total   \n    \nU.S.     27      20      47   \nInternational      9       22       31   \n             \n          \nTotal     36      42      78   \n                       \nITEM  3.

The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s eﬀective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S.\nor Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology\nindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume ﬂuctuations that have aﬀected stock prices in ways\nthat may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in\na given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reﬂect expectations of future growth and\nproﬁtability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reﬂect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its\ncurrent share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s\nshare repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speciﬁc number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nproﬁtability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline signiﬁcantly, which could have a material\nadverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 2.    Properties\nThe Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate\nfunctions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing\nfacilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\nItem 3.    Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) ﬁled a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company\nalleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company ﬁled\na counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten\ncounts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found\nthat certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision.\nThe Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.

The preparation of these consolidated ﬁnancial\nstatements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial\nstatements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s ﬁscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter every\nﬁve or six years to realign the Company’s ﬁscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s ﬁscal year 2023\nspanned 53 weeks, whereas ﬁscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33\n\n{'page': 36, 'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Apple_2023.pdf'}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 4:\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely aﬀect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to oﬀer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company’s\nproducts and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty\nabout how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into\nspecialized applications, including health and ﬁnancial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the\nCompany’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business,\nreputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business may be\nannounced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to eﬀectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the\nCompany is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place\nthat are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be eﬀective in preventing a violation or a claim\nof a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational\nharm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition,\nthe Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its\nother non-ﬁnancial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and\ngovernance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and\ngovernance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the\nCompany to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance\nlaws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the\nCompany to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company\nmay make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require\nfurther changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps\noutside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the\n\n{'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Apple_2022.pdf', 'page': 17}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 5:\n\nApple Annual Report 2022\nForm 10-K (NASDAQ:AAPL)\nPublished: October 28th, 2022\nPDF generated by \nstocklight.com\n\n{'page': 0, 'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Apple_2022.pdf'}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 6:\n\nItem 9B.

The timing of product introductions can\nalso impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are ﬁlled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel\ninventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be aﬀected when consumers and distributors anticipate\na product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team\nmembers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company\nrecognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and\npersonal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to\nsupport employees’ individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment\nwhere everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the\nCompany conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identiﬁes potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to\nmitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting speciﬁc programs in place\nfor those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and\ncustomers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports ﬁled pursuant to Sections\n13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are ﬁled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nSuch reports and other information ﬁled by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-ﬁlings/default.aspx\nwhen such reports are available on the SEC’s website.

The\nextent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and ﬁnancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors\noutside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability,\ndistribution and eﬀectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy\nand demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse eﬀects on demand for the Company’s\nproducts and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s\nprofitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely aﬀects the Company’s business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price, it may also have the eﬀect\nof heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can\nharm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse eﬀect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\ngenerally beneﬁts from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conﬂicts can result in\ntariﬀs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, particularly if these measures occur\nin regions where the Company derives a signiﬁcant portion of its revenues and/or has signiﬁcant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S.\nand China have led to a series of tariﬀs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariﬀs increase the cost of\nthe Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the\nCompany earns on its products. Tariﬀs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less\ncompetitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could\nadversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to oﬀer its products and services as designed. These measures can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to oﬀer third-party applications on its\nplatforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\nCompany’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to eﬀectively mitigate all adverse\nimpacts from such measures. If disputes and conﬂicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be signiﬁcantly more severe and\nrestrictive and could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a\nnegative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that\n\n{'page': 9, 'source': '/content/RAG_Workshop_DHS2024/data/Annual Reports/Apple_2022.pdf'}\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.\n\nDocument 5:\n\nItem 2.    Properties\nThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions,\nR&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and\nequipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\nItem 3.    Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) ﬁled a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of\nfederal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District\nCourt ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the\nCompany’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from\nincluding in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S.\nstorefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) aﬃrmed the District Court’s ruling.\nOn June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both\npetitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S.\nSupreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.\nMasimo\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) ﬁled a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging\ninfringement by the Company of ﬁve patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a\npermanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26,\n2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing\nfunctionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into eﬀect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently\nexpected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period\nfor amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely\naffected.\nItem 4.
